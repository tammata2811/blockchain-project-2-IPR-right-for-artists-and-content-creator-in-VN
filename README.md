Overview of my topic

1. Introduction
In the era of digital transformation, protecting intellectual property (IP) has become more challenging than ever, especially for artists and content creators. The proliferation of digital content makes it easy for works to be copied, shared, or used without proper authorization. Traditional legal frameworks often struggle to keep up with this pace, particularly in areas such as copyright enforcement and digital rights management.

Blockchain technology, with its unique features of decentralization, immutability, and transparency, is emerging as a promising tool to bridge this gap. Project bước đầu explores the fundamental principles of blockchain, the current legal framework for IP in Vietnam, and global case studies to assess how blockchain can be applied effectively in protecting the IP rights of artists and creators.

2. Blockchain: Core Principles and Relevance to IPR Protection

2.1. Decentralization

Blockchain operates as a decentralized, distributed ledger. Unlike traditional databases managed by central authorities, blockchain networks involve multiple nodes, each storing identical copies of data. This architecture eliminates single points of failure and ensures transparency across all participants. For IP protection, this means that every transaction or registration of ownership is permanently recorded and viewable, making tampering or unauthorized alterations virtually impossible.

This transparency helps in validating authorship, tracing ownership history, and resolving disputes over who created or owns a piece of content — all critical issues for artists and content creators in the digital age.

Benefits for intellectual property:

Anti-counterfeiting and fraud: Once data (e.g. creation date, author identity) is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be edited without being detected, creating clear legal evidence.

Eliminates reliance on registries: Artists and creators do not need to rely on a single organization (e.g. Copyright Office) to prove ownership. They can register and claim ownership directly on the blockchain, with instant verification.
Reality in Vietnam: Copyright registration in Vietnam is still mainly manual and time-consuming. Blockchain can help create an “independent and immutable” storage system for author and work information, helping artists protect their rights without having to go through complicated administrative processes.

2.2. Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are self-executing pieces of code that automatically perform transactions once certain conditions are met. For example, a smart contract could automatically release royalty payments when a digital artwork is purchased or used. This removes intermediaries, reduces transaction costs, and minimizes the risk of non-payment.

For content creators, smart contracts enable a new model of monetization — one that is automated, direct, and fair.

Applications in the field of IPR:

Automatic copyright payments: For example, when a song is played on a streaming platform, smart contracts can automatically divide revenue to singers, musicians, producers, etc. according to a predetermined rate.
Licensing of works: Users can buy licenses to use images, videos, and music directly through a blockchain transaction - this is instant and transparent.
Transfer of ownership: When a work is sold, ownership can also be transferred through a smart contract without complicated paperwork.

Advantages for Vietnamese artists: Smart contracts help them control the entire distribution, licensing, and payment process - without depending on intermediaries such as distributors, record labels, or producers.

2.3. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)
a. Definition and Operation Mechanism

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are a type of unique, non-fungible digital asset. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum (each coin is identical and can be replaced), each NFT carries a separate value, tied to a unique work, data or digital asset.

Each NFT is encoded and stored on the blockchain, accompanied by metadata containing information such as:

Name of work
Author / owner
Time of creation / minting of the token (minting date)
Description of ownership and usage rights

This mechanism ensures that the NFT holder can verify the authenticity and ownership of the digital asset associated with that token without going through any intermediary organization.

b. NFT Applications in Intellectual Property Protection

Authentication of Digital Artwork Ownership
NFTs help artists, designers, musicians or photographers attach a "digital certificate" to each of their works. Once the work is created and "minted" into an NFT, information about the work will be permanently recorded and cannot be modified on the blockchain.
 This is extremely important for works that cannot be easily authenticated by traditional means, such as digital paintings, original recordings, 3D designs, etc.
Anti-Plagiarism and Copyright Fraud
Thanks to the immutability and transparency of blockchain, NFTs become irrefutable evidence in the event of copyright disputes.
A work with an earlier creation date, recorded through NFTs, will have a legal advantage in proving who is the first creator.
Trading and commercializing digital works
NFTs open up a global market for digital art. Creators in Vietnam can sell their works to buyers anywhere, without going through a distributor or agent.

More importantly, NFTs support periodic royalties for artists even after the work has been resold multiple times on the secondary market - something that traditional methods are difficult to ensure.

Integrated with smart contracts
NFTs can be integrated with smart contracts to automate profit sharing, authorization of use, or limit the number of copies created.

c. Benefits for artists and creators in Vietnam

Increased control and initiative: Creators no longer depend on third parties to register or distribute their works.
Access to global markets: NFT exchanges (such as OpenSea, Rarible, Foundation...) allow access to millions of collectors worldwide.
Transparency of transactions and income: All transactions are publicly recorded, easy to audit and anti-fraud.
Preserving the long-term value of the work: Each NFT is a "unique work", helping to increase the value of the collection.

d. Current challenges and barriers

Lack of legal corridor in Vietnam: Currently, NFT is not officially recognized by Vietnamese law as a type of asset. This causes difficulties when disputes arise or rights need to be protected before the law.
Risk of plagiarism when minting other people's works: Although NFT is strong technical evidence, there are still cases where other people take works that are not theirs to mint into NFT first.
Costs and technical barriers: Minting NFTs on popular blockchains (like Ethereum) can be costly (gas fees) and require users to have knowledge of wallets, encryption, etc.
Permanence and access: If the artwork’s data is stored elsewhere than the blockchain (off-chain), the NFT can still be at risk of losing its content if the server containing the original file fails.

2.4. Interoperability and Global Accessibility
Blockchain operates on open standards that can be accessed from anywhere in the world. This provides artists and creators with borderless tools to register, manage, and license their IP rights.

Impact for Vietnamese Creators:

Global exposure: Vietnamese artists can tokenize their works (e.g., as NFTs) and sell or license them on international platforms without intermediaries.
Cross-border rights management: Blockchain can record licensing agreements that are recognized across jurisdictions, reducing the friction in global content distribution.
 This allows local talent in Vietnam to compete in the international creative economy, access new markets, and receive global recognition and compensation.

3. Vietnam’s Legal Framework on Intellectual Property
3.1. Current Legislation

Vietnam's intellectual property rights are governed by the Law on Intellectual Property (2005), amended and supplemented in 2009, 2019, and 2022. This legal system provides protection for various types of IP, including copyrights, trademarks, patents, industrial designs, and trade secrets.

Recent amendments have focused on aligning Vietnam's IP laws with global standards (e.g., TRIPS, CPTPP) and improving digital copyright enforcement. However, enforcement remains largely manual and bureaucratic, especially in registering copyrights and verifying ownership.

3.2. Challenges in the Current System

Manual registration processes make it slow and vulnerable to manipulation.
Lack of a centralized digital registry for real-time IP verification.
Difficulty proving ownership or authorship in digital spaces, especially when works are copied or shared without consent.
Limited public awareness among creators about IP protection and registration processes.
These gaps underscore the need for a technological solution — like blockchain — that ensures transparency, security, and ease of verification.

4. Global Case Studies
4.1. WIPO and EUIPO Initiatives

The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) have both piloted blockchain-based platforms for registering and tracking IP rights.
These projects aim to establish digital timestamps, prove authorship, and combat counterfeit goods.
Blockchain is used to automate IP ownership transfer, validate rights across borders, and facilitate smart contracts for licensing and royalties.
4.2. Applications of Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are being deployed in creative industries to:

Automate royalty distribution when music is streamed or digital art is resold.
Allow fractional ownership of content, where multiple creators share profits transparently.
Ensure usage rights and licensing terms are embedded in the digital asset itself.
These applications show that blockchain isn't just theoretical — it’s already shaping the global IP ecosystem.

4.3. Limitations and Challenges

There are several challenges remain:

Legal uncertainties: Many jurisdictions, including Vietnam, lack comprehensive laws recognizing blockchain records or smart contracts as legal evidence.
High deployment costs: Building blockchain infrastructure can be costly and technically complex.
User education: Creators often lack knowledge about how to use blockchain or NFTs effectively.
These limitations highlight the need for cross-sector collaboration — between 
governments, tech developers, and the creative community — to build usable and legally sound systems.

5. Conclusion
Blockchain offers a transformative solution to longstanding challenges in intellectual property protection, particularly for artists and digital content creators. With its core principles of decentralization, immutability, and smart automation, blockchain enables more secure, transparent, and efficient management of rights.

In Vietnam, although the legal framework for IP has progressed, significant hurdles remain in enforcement and digital proof of ownership. By learning from global experiments such as those by WIPO and EUIPO, Vietnam has the opportunity to integrate blockchain into its IP system — not only improving protection for creators but also stimulating innovation and global competitiveness.

Therefore, for widespread adoption, regulatory support, cost reduction, and capacity building are essential. Future research should explore how Vietnam can develop a hybrid legal-tech framework, potentially in partnership with international organizations, to empower local creators in the global digital economy.
